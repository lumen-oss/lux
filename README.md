## :star2: Key Features

* Create and manage Lua projects
  - Easily manage dependencies, build steps and more through the `lux.toml` file.
* Parallel builds and installs :rocket:
* Add/remove dependencies with simple CLI commands
* Automatic generation of rockspecs
  - Say goodbye to managing 10 different rockspec files in your source code :tada:
* Integrated code formatting via `lx fmt`
  - Powered by [stylua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua)
* Easily specify compatible Lua versions
  - Lux will take care of Lua header installation automatically
  - Forget about users complaining they have the wrong Lua headers installed on their system
* Automatic code linting via `lx check`
  - Powered by `luacheck`
* Powerful lockfile support
  - Makes for fully reproducible developer environments
  - Makes Lux easy to integrate with Nix!
* Fully compatible
  - Have a complex rockspec that you don't want to rewrite to TOML? No problem!
    Lux allows the creation of an `extra.rockspec` file, so everything just works
  - Have a very complex build script? Lux can shell out to `luarocks` if it knows it has
    to preserve maximum compatibility.

> [!WARNING]
>
> **Lux, while generally functional, is a work in progress
> and does not have a `1.0` release yet.**

## :gear: How To Use

Feel free to consult the [documentation](https://nvim-neorocks.github.io/tutorial/getting-started) on how to get started with Lux!

It features a tutorial and several guides to make you good at managing Lua projects.

## :bar_chart: Comparison with `luarocks`

As this project is still a work in progress, some luarocks features
have not been (fully) implemented yet.
On the other hand, lux has some features that are not present in luarocks.

The following table provides a brief comparison:

[^1]: Supported via a compatibility layer that uses luarocks as a backend.
[^2]: [You Aren't Gonna Need It.](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html)
[^3]: Mostly compatible with the luarocks version parser,
      which allows an arbitrary number of version components.
      To comply with SemVer, we treat anything after the third version component
      (except for the specrev) as a prerelease/build version.
